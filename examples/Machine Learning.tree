Machine learning is [a process](1) where computers [learn from data](2) to [perform tasks better.](3)
a subfield of Artificial Intelligence (AI)
identify patterns within [large datasets](2) using [statistical algorithms](3)
improve their performance without being explicitly programmed
large datasets, often referred to as 'training data'
statistical algorithms, such as [supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning](1)
supervised learning (which uses labeled data), unsupervised learning (which finds hidden structures), and reinforcement learning (which learns via trial and error)
