process in plant biology
plants containing [chlorophyll](3)
capture sunlight [through leaves](4), [absorb water](3) through roots, and take in carbon dioxide from the air
create glucose, [a type of sugar](4), [used for energy and growth](5)
chlorophyll — the green pigment in chloroplasts that absorbs light energy —
pull water from the soil via osmosis and transport it via the xylem
through structures in their leaves called chloroplasts that perform the light-dependent reactions
a six-carbon carbohydrate that stores chemical energy in its bonds
that can be broken down during cellular respiration to release ATP, which powers cellular processes
